#### Expense Tracker

Design an  expense tracker application using Express & MongoDB where a logged in user can track their income, expenses and savings.

2. Login users

- login using email/password combination
- login with social OAuth (Github + Google)
- verify email for local login using nodemailer
- reset apssword for local login
- A user can register & then login using email/password or he/she can directly login using social OAuth. Structure schema so that all 3 login data should be saved in same document for a single user.

- Each logged in user can add income along with their sources
- Each added income will have
  - source like salary, trading, bussiness etc..
  - amount
